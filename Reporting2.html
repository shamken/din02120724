    <h1>HOW TO USE AND IMPLEMENT HTML</h1>
    <p>Because HTML is completely text-based, an HTML file can be edited simply by opening it up in a program such as Notepad++, Vi or Emacs. Any text editor can be used to create or edit an HTML file and, so long as it is named with an .html file extension, any web browser -- such as Chrome or Firefox -- will be capable of displaying the file as a webpage.<br><br>

For professional software developers, there are a variety of WYSIWYG editors to develop webpages. NetBeans, IntelliJ, Eclipse and Microsoft's Visual Studio provide WYSIWYG editors as either plugins or as standard components, making it incredibly easy to use and implement HTML.<br><br>

These WYSIWYG editors also provide HTML troubleshooting facilities, although modern web browsers often contain web developer plugins that will highlight problems with HTML pages, such as a missing closing tag or syntax that does not create well-formed HTML.<br><br>

Chrome and Firefox both include HTML developer tools that allow for the immediate viewing of a webpage's complete HTML file, along with the ability to edit HTML on the fly and immediately incorporate changes within the internet browser.</p>
    <h1>HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT</h1>
    <p>HTML is used to create webpages but does experience limitations when it comes to fully responsive components. Therefore, HTML should only be used to add text elements and structure them within a page. For more complex features, HTML can be combined with cascading style sheets (CSS) and JavaScript (JS).<br><br>

An HTML file can link to a cascading style sheet or JS file -- usually at the top of the document with a specified file path -- which will contain information about which colors to use, which fonts to use and other HTML element rendering information. JavaScript also allows developers to include more dynamic functionality, such as pop-ups and photo sliders, in a webpage. Tags called class attributes are used to match HTML elements to their corresponding CSS or JS elements.<br><br>

For example, if a user wants the color of a certain amount of text to be red, they can write code in the CSS file with an accompanying class attribute that turns text red. Then they can place the associated class attribute on all the pieces of text they want to be red in the HTML sheet. The same basic method applies to JS sheets, with different functions.<br><br>

Separating information about how a page is structured, the role of HTML, from the information about how a webpage looks when it is rendered in a browser is a software development pattern and best practice known as separation of concerns.</p>
    <h1>HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT</h1>
    <p>In the early days of the world wide web, marking up text-based documents using HTML syntax was more than sufficient to facilitate the sharing of academic documents and technical memos. However, as the internet expanded beyond the walls of academia and into the homes of the general population, greater demand was placed on webpages in terms of formatting and interactivity.<br><br>

HTML 4.01 was released in 1999, at a time when the internet was not yet a household name, and HTML5 was not standardized until 2014. During this time, HTML markup drifted from the job of simply describing the document structure of webpage content into the role of also describing how content should look when a webpage displays it.<br><br>

As a result, HTML4-based webpages often included information within a tag about what font to use when displaying text, what color should be used for the background and how content should be aligned. Describing within an HTML tag how an HTML element should be formatted when rendered on a webpage is considered an HTML antipattern. HTML should generally describe how content is structured, not how it will be styled and rendered within a browser. Other markup languages are better suited to this task.<br><br>

One major difference between HTML4 and HTML5 is that the separation of concerns pattern is more rigorously enforced in HTML5 than it was in HTML4. With HTML5, the bold < b > and italicize < i > tags have been deprecated. For the paragraph tag, the align attribute has been completely removed from the HTML specification.</p>
