    <h1>HTML VERSIONS</h1>
    <p><b>The following is a list of HTML versions and the years they were created. Several iterations of each version have been released over time. This list aims to focus on significant iterations.</b><br><br>

HTML 1.0 -- released in 1992 -- had very limited capability and around 20 elements.<br>
HTML 2.0 -- released in 1995 -- began to incorporate elements relating to math functions.<br>
HTML 3.2 -- released in 1996 -- dropped the math function initiative altogether, and fixed overlap between various proprietary extensions.<br>
HTML 4.0 -- released in 1997 -- offered three variations which differed in the number of deprecated elements that were allowed.<br>
HTML 4.01 -- released in 1999 -- largely the same as 4.0.<br>
HTML 5 -- released in 2014 -- came after a long break in updates because the organization that developed it -- W3C -- was focusing on another, parallel language called XHTML.<br>
HTML 5.1 -- released in 2016 -- aimed to more easily accommodate various types of media embedding with new tags.<br>
HTML 5.2 -- released in 2017 -- aimed to be equally understandable by humans and computers.<br>
HTML 5.3 -- yet to be released -- W3C is collaborating with WHATWG on a new version. The collaboration began in 2019.</p>
    <h1>Features of HTML5</h1>
    <p>HTML5 introduces several elements to increase interactivity, multimedia capabilities and semantic efficiency. Instead of using plugins, multimedia can be placed within the HTML code. These elements include:<br><br>

<b>Graphics elements:</b><br><br>
< canvas >, which creates a blank rectangular space in which web designers can draw using JavaScript.<br>
< svg >, which is a container for scalable vector graphics (SVG).<br><br>
<b>Semantic elements:</b><br><br>
< header >, which creates a header at the top of the page.<br>
< footer >, which creates a footer at the bottom of the page.<br>
< article>, which creates an area for independent content.<br>
< section >, which defines sections and subsections such as chapters, or headers and footers when more than one are necessary.<br>
< nav >, which creates a navigation menu.<br><br>
<b>Multimedia elements:</b><br>
< audio >, which describes MP3 files, WAV files and OGG files in HTML.<br>
< video >, which describes MP4, WebM and OGG video types.<br>
Attributes that apply to the < form > element, which creates an area for user input on the web page. These include number, date, calendar and range.<br><br>
<b>Other main features of HTML5 include:</b><br><br>

•Elimination of outmoded or redundant attributes.<br>
•Offline editing.<br>
•The ability to drag and drop between HTML5 documents.
•Messaging enhancements.<br>
•Detailed parsing<br>
•MIME and protocol handler registration.<br>
•A common standard for storing data in SQL databases (Web SQL).<br>
•Application program interfaces (API) for complex applications.<br>
•Accommodations for mobile device app development.<br>
•MathML for mathematical and scientific formulas.<br><br>
While the addition of these features represents an effort to support multimedia embedding, changes to the HTML specification demonstrate the desire of the community for HTML to return to its original purpose of describing the structure of content. Basically, more structural features have been added, while several format-centric features have been deprecated. For the purpose of backward-compatibility, web browsers will continue to support deprecated HTML tags, but eventually HTML will be mainly structure-based.</p>
